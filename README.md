# HSRTools
A toolkit to perform MDS encoding/decoding on data blocks with Hybrid Shift-XOR encoding and decoding algorithm. Target of this implementation is to expose the outstanding characteristics of our algorithms and to outperform Google and Facebook's current methods in File System MDS encoding/decoding.
