# HSRTools
A toolkit to perform MDS encoding/decoding on data blocks with Hybrid Shift-XOR encoding and decoding algorithm. Target of this implementation is to expose the outstanding characteristics of our algorithms and to outperform Google and Facebook's current methods in File System MDS encoding/decoding.

## Note

Currently this toolkit is under intensive development. We set three stage goal as milestones

- Stage 1: Produce encode/decode toolkit on parameter (6,3) and (8,3), ETA June 30th 2020
- Stage 2: Generalize the toolkit with perl script. ETA mid July 2020
- Stage 3: Finalize documentation and paperwork. ETA July 30th 2020

## Env

To use our tools please ensure following dependencies are available on your system

- perl
- gnu c/c++ compilers
